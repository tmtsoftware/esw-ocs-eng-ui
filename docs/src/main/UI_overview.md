# UI Overview

TMT Observatory will use many web applications to observe and manage the observatory instruments and telescope systems. 

The User interfaces for TMT can be grouped into two categories: observing user interfaces and engineering user interfaces. For the engineering user interfaces, browser-based UI will provide an easy solution for remote access to systems and services.

ESW's UISTD Phase 1 provides style and layout guidelines and standards (look-and-feel) with examples that demonstrate the guidelines. UISTD also provides glue code for the JavaScript-based environment that is used by UI builders to access CSW services along with examples.  UISTD provides UI components that demonstrate common usage of CSW glue code.

ESW engineering user interface has been developed based on the below technologies:
