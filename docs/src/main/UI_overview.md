# UI Overview

TMT Observatory will use many web applications to observe and manage the observatory instruments and telescope systems. User interfaces can be grouped into two categories: observing user interfaces and engineering user interfaces.For the user interfaces, browser-based UI will provide an easy solution for remote access to systems and services.

ESW's UISTD provides style and layout guidelines and standards (look-and-feel) with examples that demonstrate the guidelines. UISTD also provides glue code for the JavaScript-based environment that is used by UI builders to access CSW services along with examples.  UISTD also provides UI components that demonstrate common usage of CSW glue code. 

UI has been developed based on the below technologies:
